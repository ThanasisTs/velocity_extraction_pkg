# Velocity Extraction Package

This package provides a service for generating 3D linear velocities from 3D points. It also provides a client node
which accepts a list of 3D points, calls the service and publishes a list of 3D linear velocities

To check the functionality of the package, just run in a terminal

roslaunch velocity_extraction_launch velocity_extraction_launch.launch
